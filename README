The Kapab Medical Network is designed to provide situational awareness to all 
operating hospitals within Haiti, in a way that provides readiness levels, 
patient throughput data, and hospital needs. Authenticated users can input 
information into the Kapab MedNet via SMS message, telephone, email, or 
webpage form.

The current status of the data in the Kapab MedNet will be output to a 
collection of Geotagged map projects which will package critical information 
in easy to understand views.

The Kapab Medical Network will be fully integrated within SouthCom's All 
Partners Access Network (APAN) system for better visibility.
